# ndsntp
NTP client for the Nintendo DS.

Uses the coreNTP library made by Amazon for the FreeRTOS project. It is ported for the Nintendo DS. CUrrently, the main branch contains code for the DevKitPro SDK for the Nintendo DS. A branch supporting the BlocksDS SDK is available, called `blocksds`. Future development will focus on BlocksDS because this SDK is in active development and I would like to support it.
